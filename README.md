## Description

This project provides everything a business would need to host an online shopping experience. Users can create, edit, and delete categories, products, and tags. All of your inventory is now at the touch a button.

While working on this project, I was able to better understand how Sequelize was manipulating the data and how to efficiently use the library in my code. I also connected a few dots on how the backend has such a large influence on web development.
